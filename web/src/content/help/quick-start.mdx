# Get started with Codebuff

## 1. Install Codebuff

Enter the following in your terminal, which could be inside your favorite IDE (VSCode, Cursor, etc.).

```bash
npm install -g codebuff
```

## 2. Navigate to your project directory

```bash
cd /path/to/your-repo
```

## 3. Run Codebuff

```bash
codebuff
```

Check out the [modes](/docs/tips/modes) for using Codebuff, such as Free, Max, or Plan.

## 4. Initialize Your Project (Optional)

Run the `/init` command inside Codebuff to set up project-specific files. Useful for:

- **New projects** — if you don't already have an AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md (Codebuff will also read these files).
- **Building custom agents** — running /init is the first step to [creating your own agents](/docs/walkthroughs/creating-your-first-agent)!

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (which includes npm).

- Try deleting the downloaded binary at `~/.config/manicode/codebuff` and restarting codebuff.

See [here](/docs/advanced/troubleshooting) for more help or ask in our [Discord](https://codebuff.com/discord).
